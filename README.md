DESCRIPTION:This project demonstrates how to use Python to fetch data from a public API, such as OpenWeatherMap, and create visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. It includes a script that handles data retrieval and processing, along with a basic dashboard to display the visual insights. The goal is to show how API data can be transformed into useful visual information in a clear and accessible way.
